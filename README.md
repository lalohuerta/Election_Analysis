# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview

Seth, a government employee of the Colorado state has asked me to perform an election audit of the most recent congressional election, with the following tasks:

* Calculate the total number of votes.
* Get a complete list of candidates.
* Claculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
* Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
* Determine the winner of the election.
* Calculate the votes each state generated.
* Determine which state had the major vote participation.

## Resources 

* Data Source: election_results.csv
* Software: Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio Code 1.69.2

## Election Audit Overview

The purpose of this election audit analysis was to get the accurate information from the dataset given in order to realize which candidate was the winner with the number & percentage of votes for each county, using Python software with the following tools: Navigating between folders using command line, declaring variables, creating and using data structures, decision & repetition statements, Boolean & logical operators & reading & writing data to a file.

## Election-Audit Results 
The analysis of the election shows that:
- There were 369,711 votes in the election.

- The candidates were:
  - Charles Casper Stockham obtained 23.0% of the vote 85,213 votes.
  - Diana DeGette obtained 73.8% of the vote 272,892 votes.
  - Raymon Anthony Doane obtained 3.1% of the vote 11,606 votes. 

- Votes & percentage per County:
  - Jefferson: 10.5% - 38,855 votes
  - Denver: 82.8% - 306,055 votes
  - Arapahoe: 6.7% - 24,801 votes

- The County with the major participation in the election was Denver.

- The winner of the electionn was:
  - Diana DeGette who obtained 73.8% of the vote 272,892 votes.
  
## Election-Audit Summary 
It can be concluded that for the election in the state of Colorado, Denver is an important county to win or lose the election due to its high participation and influence on the results, we can see that Diana's triumph promotes gender parity. Finally, in the next elections, the root cause of low participation would have to be identified to promote more voting in Arapahoe County because it was the county with the least electoral participation.
